Questions related to string operations in programming interviews can vary widely in complexity and focus. Here are several examples of implementation questions related to string operations that may be asked:

<b>Reverse a String:</b> Write a function to reverse a given string. For example, given "hello", return "olleh".

Check Palindrome: Write a function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome. For example, "radar" and "level" are palindromes.

Anagram Detection: Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. For example, "listen" and "silent" are anagrams.

String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string "aabcccccaaa" would become "a2b1c5a3".

String Rotation: Given two strings, check if one string is a rotation of the other, using only one call to a substring method. For example, "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat".

Unique Characters: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. For example, "abcde" has all unique characters, but "hello" does not.

Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters. For example, the longest substring without repeating characters in "abcabcbb" is "abc", which has a length of 3.

String Permutations: Write a function to generate all permutations of a given string.

Count Characters: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of each character in a string.

String Matching: Implement a function to check if a given string matches a given pattern, where the pattern may contain wildcard characters such as '*' and '?'.

Remove Duplicates: Write a function to remove duplicate characters from a string without using any additional buffer.

String Concatenation: Implement a function to concatenate two strings without using the built-in concatenation operator.

Edit Distance: Given two strings, determine the minimum number of operations required to convert one string into the other, where operations include insertion, deletion, or substitution of a character.

Longest Common Subsequence: Given two strings, find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of them.
